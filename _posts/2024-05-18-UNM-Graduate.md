I’m proud to share that I’ve officially graduated from the **University of New Mexico** with a **Bachelor of Science in Computer Science**.  

This milestone marks the completion of years of study, collaboration, and exploration across topics ranging from **systems programming and cybersecurity** to **simulation, AI, and space systems engineering**.  
Throughout my undergraduate experience, I developed a strong foundation in both theory and application — working on research that combined software security with NASA’s small-satellite simulation environments, and contributing to projects that bridged computer science with real-world mission contexts.

Beyond academics, my time at UNM taught me the value of persistence, mentorship, and curiosity-driven learning.  
I’m deeply grateful to my professors, mentors, and peers who made this journey possible — and excited to carry these experiences forward into graduate research and beyond.
