I’m thrilled to share that I’ve been accepted into the **Master of Science in Computer Science** program at the **University of New Mexico**.  

This milestone represents the next step in my journey toward specializing in **cybersecurity and space systems engineering**.  
During my undergraduate studies, I discovered a strong passion for the intersection of software, security, and aerospace technology — interests I plan to continue exploring through advanced research and hands-on simulation work.

At UNM, I’ll be joining an environment that fosters collaboration across disciplines, with opportunities to work alongside NASA IV&V and the state’s growing space technology community.  
My goals include contributing to research on **secure satellite software architectures**, publishing in leading cybersecurity conferences, and mentoring undergraduates interested in applied systems security.

Excited, grateful, and ready for the challenges ahead.
