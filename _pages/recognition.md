## Inclusion in MITRE SPARTA Matrix
In 2025, our work on **SpyChain: Multi-Vector Supply Chain Attacks in Small Satellites** led to the discovery of a previously undocumented malware technique involving **multi-component coordination for covert execution**.  
This approach—where two or more compromised satellite components collaborate through covert triggers and data channels—was formally acknowledged and added to the **MITRE SPARTA** framework as a new technique under *Defense Evasion* with ID **DE-0012: Component Collusion**.

This recognition establishes one of the first contributions to the SPARTA Matrix directly originating from an **academic small satellite cybersecurity study**, bridging simulation-based research with practical threat modeling standards used by government and industry.

> *“Component Collusion — This technique involves two or more compromised components operating in coordination to conceal malicious activity.”*

## NASA NOS3 Team Acknowledgement
Our work has also received direct **acknowledgement from NASA’s NOS3 development team**, who validated the study’s findings and expressed interest in future collaborations to enhance NOS3’s cybersecurity testing capabilities.

NASA’s engagement affirms both the **scientific validity** and **practical relevance** of our SpyChain and Silent Subverion simulations:
- **Platform:** NASA Operational Simulator for Small Satellites (NOS3)  
- **Recognition:** Formal communication and confirmation of simulation integrity and defense recommendations  
- **Impact:** Sparked dialogue on integrating **cybersecurity-focused testbed capabilities** into NOS3 for future research missions  

This collaboration highlights the value of open simulation environments for advancing small-satellite cybersecurity and emphasizes the importance of bridging academic research with operational testbeds used by NASA and its partners.
